# VidIStream Unified Suite

## Overview
VidIStream is now the single home for every YouTube growth workflow that previously lived across the repository. The Next.js application inside the `vidstream` directory merges the strongest capabilities of the original five projects into one cohesive interface that outperforms tools like VidIQ.

## Integrated Capabilities
- **Channel Command Center** – Streamlit dashboards and forecasting notebooks were rebuilt as native dashboard views so you can audit channel health, surface historic insights, and monitor performance trajectories without leaving VidIStream.
- **AI SEO Studio** – The Python-based Advanced YouTube SEO Generator now powers an interactive metadata lab that produces titles, descriptions, tags, hashtags, and projected impact with tone and hook controls.
- **Keyword Suggestion Lab** – Legacy jQuery + PHP autocomplete tooling was reimagined with modern React components that score, deduplicate, and copy Google/YouTube keyword clusters in seconds.
- **Shorts Studio** – Remotion short-video maker blueprints, scene planners, and render presets live alongside automation checklists to streamline short-form production.
- **Automation Hub** – Scheduling spreadsheets and comment intelligence scripts evolved into a unified automation pipeline that coordinates community posts, reminders, and workflow toggles.

A full breakdown of every dashboard, tool, and scoring model is available in [`vidstream/VIDSTREAM_FEATURES.md`](vidstream/VIDSTREAM_FEATURES.md).
